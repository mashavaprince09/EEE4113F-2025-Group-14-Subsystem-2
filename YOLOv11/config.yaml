# Class Definitions
nc: 2
names: ["Moulting_Penguin", "Penguin_Not_Moulting"]

# Enhanced Augmentation Strategy
augment:
  # Geometric Transformations
  degrees: 25.0  # Increased rotation for better viewpoint coverage
  translate: 0.2  # More translation to simulate camera movement
  scale: 0.6  # Wider scale range
  shear: 10.0  # Increased shear for perspective variation
  perspective: 0.001  # Camera perspective adjustment
  flipud: 0.4  # Vertical flips (common in penguin images)

  # Color Adjustments
  hsv_h: 0.03  # Enhanced hue variation for moulting colors
  hsv_s: 0.9  # Higher saturation variation
  hsv_v: 0.7  # Brighter value variations
  motion_blur: 0.3  # Simulate camera movement

  # Advanced Augmentations
  mosaic: 1.0
  mixup: 0.7  # Increased mixup probability
  copy_paste: 0.3  # More occlusion handling
  auto_augment: "randaugment"  # Learned augmentation policy

# Training Parameters
multi_scale: [704, 736, 768]  # Optimized for 768px target
cls: 3.0  # Direct class weight (2Ã— focus on moulting class)
fl_gamma: 2.0  # Focal loss for hard example mining

# Architecture Adjustments
anchors:
  - [12,16, 19,36, 40,28]  # Adjusted P3/8 anchors
  - [36,75, 76,55, 72,146]  # Adjusted P4/16 anchors
  - [142,110, 192,243, 459,401]  # Adjusted P5/32 anchors

# Loss Component Weights
loss:
  box: 0.06  # Bounding box loss
  cls: 0.8  # Class prediction loss
  obj: 0.9  # Objectness loss

  # In config.yaml
augmentation:
  hsv_h: 0.01  # Reduced color variation
  degrees: 10.0  # Lower rotation
loss:
  cls_pw: 3.0  # Stronger class weighting
